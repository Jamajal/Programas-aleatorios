The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall
If you set your goals ridiculously high and it's a failure, you will fail above everyone else's success
Spread love everywhere you go. Let no one ever come to you without leaving happier
Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail
It is during our darkest moments that we must focus to see the light
Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail
In the end, it's not the years in your life that count. It's the life in your years
You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself any direction you choose
In the end, it's not the years in your life that count. It's the life in your years
In this life we cannot do great things. We can only do small things with great love
The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall
Keep smiling, because life is a beautiful thing and there's so much to smile about
You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself any direction you choose
Many of life's failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up
Success is not final; failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts
I find that the harder I work, the more luck I seem to have
Don't be distracted by criticism. Remember, the only taste of success some people get is to take a bite out of you
Success seems to be connected with action. Successful people keep moving. They make mistakes but they don't quit
The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today
Successful people do what unsuccessful people are not willing to do. Don't wish it were easier; wish you were better
